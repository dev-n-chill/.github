# 🏖️💻 dev-n-chill

**dev-n-chill** is a private collection of reusable Luau modules for internal use across various Roblox projects.
The APIs have been **intentionally designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible**, so the modules are easy to integrate and use with minimal setup.

## 📦 Dependencies

Certain modules rely on external libraries.
However, you only need to download the dependencies required by the modules you actually use.
Don't bulk download everything — many modules work independently or only depend on a subset of the following:

- [`Signal`](https://github.com/Sleitnick/RbxUtil/blob/main/modules/signal/init.luau)
