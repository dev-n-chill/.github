# ‚ùÑÔ∏è chill-libs

**chill-libs** is a private collection of reusable Luau modules for internal use across various Roblox projects.

While most of the code was initially written by Serokai, **any contributor is welcome to help improve or extend** the libraries ‚Äî feel free to submit PRs or contribute through GitHub‚Äôs built-in tools.

The APIs have been **intentionally designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible**, so the modules are easy to integrate and use with minimal setup.
